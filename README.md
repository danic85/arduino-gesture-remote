arduino-gesture-remote
======================

Control your TV with simple gestures.

This is a fairly simple project that is designed to introduce key components to a new Arduino user. I created this in a few hours of tinkering using existing Arduino libraries and a SainSmart starter kit. Real world applications could include users who have difficulty using remote controls or are in food preparation areas etc.

The IR code is configured for use with a Sony TV, the library is courtesy of http://www.righto.com/2009/08/multi-protocol-infrared-remote-library.html
I also took some IR codes for the TV from here: http://www.openremote.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=15532260

Everything else uses the built in Arduino functions and libraries or my own work.

To find out how to build the device, see http://www.dannicholson.co.uk/2013/07/23/arduino-ultrasonic-gesture-based-tv-remote-control/ or http://www.instructables.com/id/Ultrasonic-gesture-based-TV-remote-control/
